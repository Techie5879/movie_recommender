MOVIE++ 
===

Getting Recommendations for movies is hard. There just so much to choose from once you open up IMDb!

So I present my (first!) project, MOVIE++, a movie recommender system using Singular Value Decomposition Matrix Factorization Algorithms and item-based Collaborative Filtering.  
It takes a movie name as user input through the form, and spits out 15 recommended movies based on my Machine Learning model.
